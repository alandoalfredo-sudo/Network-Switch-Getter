- Increase timeout values
- Check network congestion
- Verify device firewall settings

#### Missing Device Information
- Enable SNMP, SSH, or web interface protocols
- Check device accessibility
- Verify protocol credentials
- Review device configuration

#### App Crashes or Freezes
- Restart the app
- Check available memory
- Verify iOS version compatibility
- Report issues with device logs

### Performance Optimization
